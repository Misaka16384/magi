"""`threads/` — propositions, questions and lines, written like a forum.

One directory, one schema, three kinds (see `magi.core.vocab`). A note has two
halves and the split is the whole concurrency story:

* **the body**, owned by whoever created the note — edited freely by that one
  writer, the way any draft is;
* **`## Discussion`**, append-only — every other writer, human or agent, adds a
  signed post at the end and never touches what is already there.

Appending is therefore the only write, and it is taken under a short per-note
lock. The lock is not paranoia: this module was first written without one, on
the reasoning that `open(path, "a")` plus a single small write is serialised by
the operating system. That is true on POSIX and **false on Windows**, where the C
runtime implements `O_APPEND` as seek-to-end followed by write — two steps, and
a second writer landing between them overwrites the first. Eight concurrent
appends to one note lost two of them on the first measured run. A post is
somebody's argument; losing one silently is the worst thing this file could do,
so it holds a lock for the length of one append.

The lock is per note and held for microseconds, which keeps the property that
matters: two agents working different propositions never wait for each other,
and a crash mid-append cannot corrupt a note, because the only write is at the
end of the file.

The other reason posts exist is audit. The only mutable frontmatter field is
`status`, and a status flip must carry a post saying what moved and why. That
makes a note's history readable from the note itself, which is what lets
`validate()` check the whole transition chain from a snapshot — no journal, no
database, no memory of who was running at the time.

    the text does not depend on the note. A run's step does: its number is the
    count of steps already there, and whether it may be registered at all is a
    question about the posts before it. Two callers that each read, decided and
    then appended would both be step 7, and both be "the second of two allowed".

    `compose(note)` returns `(text, fields, dst)` — the post, frontmatter fields
    to set (or None), and a status to move to (or None). It may raise to refuse,
    and then nothing is written. Fields, status and post land under one lock,
    status before post, for the reason `set_status` gives.
