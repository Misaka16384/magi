#
# pdflatex is asked "is this well formed" and usually answers with an error.
# A few inputs make it loop instead, and under nonstopmode a loop that raises
# no error never stops: `magi ingest review --commit` sat for twenty minutes on
# one (arXiv:2108.10324 eq. 22). Every pattern here came out of LaTeXML,
# arXiv's HTML renderer, by way of pandoc, and none of it is mathematics a
# person wrote — so it is named here, by a string match, and kept out of the
# compile altogether. The deadline in `validate_math_pdflatex` is the net for
# whatever this list does not know yet.
