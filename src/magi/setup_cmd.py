"""magi setup — one-command environment provisioning and doctor.

The install scripts (install.ps1 / install.sh) bootstrap uv + the magi
CLI, then hand over to this command, which:

1. installs Beads (bd) when missing (Windows: GitHub release binary;
   elsewhere: the official installer via curl|sh)
2. pulls the Ollama embedding model when Ollama is present
3. registers the Claude Code plugin when the claude CLI is present
4. reports which other agent CLIs are installed (skills go in per
   workspace via `magi skills install`, never machine-wide)
5. detects legacy Wikify installations (old copied skills/ + bin/)
6. prints a doctor table + quick-start

Safe to re-run any time (idempotent). `magi setup --check` only reports.
Legacy copies are only DELETED with the explicit --remove-legacy flag.
