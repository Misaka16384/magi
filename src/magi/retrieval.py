"""magi index / magi search — the Casper core (retrieval state).

Hybrid local retrieval over the workspace markdown corpus:
- BM25 via stdlib SQLite FTS5
- vectors via sqlite-vec + Ollama embeddings (same model as `magi link`,
  ``models.embedding`` in config.yaml)
- fusion via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)

Degrades gracefully: when Ollama is unreachable the index still builds
(BM25-only) and hybrid searches fall back to BM25, reporting
``vector_available: false``. Cross-platform note: on macOS use a Python
whose sqlite3 supports loadable extensions (Homebrew/uv builds do).

Index lives at ``<workspace>/output/index.db``. Collections are derived
from paths: concepts / references / topics / theses / raw.
