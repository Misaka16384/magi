r"""Adopt an existing folder of research material into a MAGI project.

`magi init` already runs in a non-empty directory — it is purely additive. What
it cannot do is decide what the material already there *is*: which subtree is
someone else's papers and which is the human's own working out. That judgment
belongs to whoever can read the files. This module carries the mechanical work
around that judgment.

  survey  read-only inventory: what is here, how big, what it links to
  apply   move what a plan says to move, and record every move
  undo    put it back

What earns this module its place is `plan_rewrites`. Research folders are held
together by ordinary relative links — `plans/INDEX.md` points at
`../field-survey/` and `../mobility-barrier/WMIN.md`. Moving whole directories
happens to preserve them, but a folder messy enough to be worth adopting cannot
be fitted to MAGI's shape that way: sooner or later a file has to go somewhere
its neighbours do not. Refusing at that point hands the problem back to the
person, so `apply` repairs the links instead, in the same pass and by the same
arithmetic that found them — including the paths written in prose, which
nothing renders and nothing else would ever check.

Every repair is recorded next to the move that caused it, so `undo` puts the
words back as well as the files.

Nothing here deletes. `apply` refuses to overwrite, refuses to leave the
project, and writes a manifest `undo` can read back.
