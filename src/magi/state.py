"""What the research is doing right now, computed from the files every time.

This is the projection the rest of v2 reads: `magi next` ranks it, `MAP.md` is
it rendered for a person, `sync --close` refuses to let a session end while it
still shows debt. Nothing here is stored. A status lives in exactly one place —
the frontmatter of the note it belongs to — and everything else is arithmetic
over that. The moment a projection is written to disk it becomes a second
answer that can disagree with the first, and then somebody has to decide which
one is true.

Four things come out of the same pass over `threads/`:

**Lines.** Each research line, its phase, how many propositions are open under
it, when it last moved, and whether it has gone quiet. This is the half of
`MAP.md` a person actually reads.

**A decision queue.** Only the three kinds of event that are allowed to
interrupt somebody (design-v2 §6): a claimed result the reviewer rejected, two
writers who disagreed about a status, and a line whose direction may have
changed. Plus predictions the human owes — asked once, at the moment they are
still honest.

**Bookkeeping debt.** Not "work that is left" — *work that happened and was not
written down*. A proposition whose status the posts do not explain; a
derivation edited after the proposition that points at it last moved. Debt is
first in the `next` list because it is the cheapest thing in the system to fix
and the most expensive to leave: every other projection is wrong while it
stands.

**WIP.** How many propositions a line has open. Above the limit, the honest
next move is to close one rather than open another — a limit, not a score.
Ranking research by a number is the thing design-v2 §16 rules out; counting is
not ranking.
