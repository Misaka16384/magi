"""`magi hook <event>` — what a host's hooks call, and all it may do.

Two hooks beyond the stop gate, both on Claude Code because it is the only
host that documents any of this (design-v2 §13: "other hosts have none").

**`fanout`** counts sub-agent spawns and never blocks one. Invariant 5 in the
managed block asks the agent to say what a fan-out costs before it starts one,
and a rule that the agent alone enforces is a rule that quietly stops holding
in the sessions where it matters most. Counting makes it checkable. Blocking
would make it a budget, and design-v2 §13 is explicit that MAGI hard-manages
only the calls it starts itself — a sub-agent is the agent's own work on the
person's own account, and refusing it is not MAGI's call.

**`session-start`** is where background work happens, because §7 says there is
no daemon: everything except the radar runs when a session begins. It prints
what `magi next` would print, which is the one thing worth knowing at that
moment, and it prints nothing when there is nothing — a hook that speaks every
time teaches people to skip it.

**A hook must not be able to break a session.** Every path here ends in exit 0
with parseable JSON on stdout, including the paths where the workspace is
missing, the payload is not JSON, or a file cannot be written. A hook that
errors is a hook the person turns off, and then the gate it guarded is gone.
