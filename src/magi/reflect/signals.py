"""What MAGI itself knows went well or badly, without asking a model.

The slow loop reads transcripts, but transcripts are the *expensive* half and
the ambiguous one: a session where somebody was frustrated looks much like one
where they were thinking out loud. These signals are the cheap half — events
the notes already record, each of which happened at a knowable moment, so a
session can be picked because something in it actually went wrong rather than
because a model thought it looked interesting.

**Wins are collected too, and that is not symmetry for its own sake.** A loop
fed only failures grows only prohibitions: every proposal it can make is a
thing to stop doing. Improvements to *how* work is done can only come from
sessions where the work went well, so the sampler reserves room for them
(design-v2 §12).

Nothing here calls a model, writes a file, or decides anything. It answers one
question — *what happened, when, and on which note* — and leaves the judging to
the stage that can afford it.
