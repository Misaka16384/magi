"""magi — umbrella CLI dispatcher.

Design contract (see ROADMAP.md):
- Every deterministic operation is a subcommand; skills teach *when/why*,
  ``magi <cmd> --help`` teaches syntax.
- Subcommand modules keep their own argparse ``main(argv) -> int``; this
  dispatcher only routes. Modules are imported lazily so ``magi --help``
  stays fast and an import error in one subsystem cannot break the rest.
- JSON-capable commands accept ``--json``; their output shapes are the
  future ``magi mcp`` tool contracts — keep them stable.
