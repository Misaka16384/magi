"""magi skills — install MAGI's skills into whichever agent CLI you use.

MAGI's skills are host-agnostic prose: they teach *when and why* to run the
deterministic ``magi`` commands. What differs per host is only where the file
goes and what wrapper it needs to become a slash command. This module owns
that table, so every supported CLI gets the same skills instead of Claude
Code getting them through the plugin and everyone else copying directories by
hand. The table of hosts itself lives in `core.hosts` -- one record per CLI,
shared with the reviewer and the transcript readers.

Scopes:
- ``project`` (default) — into the MAGI workspace you are standing in, so the
  skills exist where they are useful and nowhere else.
- ``global`` — user level, every project on the machine. Opt-in only: these
  skills are about *this* research workspace (ingest into raw/, compile into
  wiki/, query the graph), so loading them into every unrelated repo just
  spends the agent's attention for nothing.

The skill files ship inside the wheel (``magi/skills/*/SKILL.md``), so this
works from a plain ``pipx``/``uv tool`` install with no repo checkout and no
network.
