"""magi sync — workspace onboarding: three-core status + sync ratio.

The sync ratio is a deterministic workspace-health score, not vibes:

- MELCHIOR (epistemic state / the wiki):
    0.55 · graph freshness (graph.db mtime >= newest wiki/*.md mtime)
  + 0.25 · backlog health  (max(0, 1 - uncompiled/10))
  + 0.20 · claim health    (verified claims / total claims; 1.0 when no
           claims exist yet — absence of claims is not a defect)
- BALTHASAR (work state / Beads):
    0.6 · beads database reachable
  + 0.4 · bd status summary readable
- CASPER (retrieval state / hybrid index):
    0.7 · index freshness (index.db mtime >= newest wiki/*.md mtime)
  + 0.3 · vector coverage (embedded chunks / total chunks)
  Missing index scores 0 — build it with `magi index`.

Ratio = weighted mean over the cores that are applicable. Agents should
treat a low ratio as "restore the workspace before doing research":
every hint printed is a concrete command.
