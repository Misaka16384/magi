"""The part of `AGENTS.md` the CLI owns, and the part it must never touch.

Every host reads an instruction file at the top of a session — `AGENTS.md` for
Codex and most others, `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, which in a MAGI workspace
holds nothing but `@AGENTS.md` so there is one text and not two. That file is
shared property: MAGI needs to keep its protocol current across upgrades, and
the person needs to write project instructions that survive the next upgrade.

So the file is split by two markers. Between them belongs to the CLI and is
rewritten whole on every `magi install`; everything outside belongs to whoever
wrote it and is never read, moved or reflowed. The alternative — appending, the
way most tools do it — is how an instruction file ends up with four copies of a
protocol that changed three times, each contradicting the last.

Three properties this has to have, because all three failure modes are silent:

* **Idempotent.** Writing the same body twice leaves identical bytes. A block
  that grows a newline per run turns every upgrade into a diff nobody reads.
* **Order-preserving.** The block stays where it was — it does not migrate to
  the end of the file when the body changes, because a person put their own
  text around it deliberately.
* **Self-healing.** A file that somehow ends up with two blocks converges to
  one. Two blocks is the same disease as appending, arrived at differently:
  two protocols in one file and no way to know which the host obeyed.

Markers are read the way the rest of the repo reads markdown structure —
`md_blocks.classify_lines`, so a fenced example of what the markers look like
is an example and not a block. Without that, documenting this format inside
`AGENTS.md` would cause the next `install` to splice the live protocol into the
middle of the code fence, where a host reads it as sample text.

Run `magi next` first — it reads the notes and says what to do, and never acts.
`magi --help` is the command surface; `magi guide --search "<error>"` is the manual.

## Where things live
- `raw/` — sources, as converted: re-ingest, never rewrite — except a formula the
  conversion broke: `magi math repair`/`format` (`magi math undo` reverts a run),
  then the `tidy` skill. `[omitted: …]` in a formula is a figure it removed.
- `wiki/references/` — compiled from `raw/`. Rebuild, never hand-edit.
- `wiki/concepts/`, `wiki/topics/` — shared knowledge. Edit freely.
- `drafts/` — the working out. `threads/` — propositions, questions, lines.
- `inbox/notes.md` — anything, unsorted. `decisions.md` — what a person decided.
- `output/` — derived and rebuildable, **except** `ingest/ radar/ reflect/
  adopt/ tidy/ llm-ledger.jsonl`: those record what a person decided, what it
  cost, and how to undo a change. Nothing rebuilds those.

## Invariants
1. Evidence points at `raw/`, never at a card compiled from it.
2. One file, one temperature — a conjecture inside a concept card is a
   proposition; open one and leave a wikilink.
3. A status flip carries a post: `magi thread status`, never an editor.
4. A sub-agent never asks the human. Return one line instead:
   `NEEDS-DECISION: <question> | options: <a> / <b> | default if unanswered: <x>`
   Whoever spawned it asks once, for all of them. In a scheduled run or a
   piped run there is nobody: do not guess and do not wait — stop and say
   what you would have asked.
5. Before a fan-out, say what it costs: "34 pages, so about 34 sub-agent calls".

## Before you stop
`magi sync --close` — it refuses while something happened that nobody wrote down.

Never answer a research question from memory: retrieve, then cite `[[wikilinks]]`.
