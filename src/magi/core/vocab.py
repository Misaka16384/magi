"""The v2 vocabulary, frozen in one place: kinds, statuses, who may flip what.

`threads/` is one directory with one schema and three kinds of note, and the
whole point of that design is that a status word is a *fact the system reacts
to* rather than something an agent narrates. `magi next` reads statuses,
`sync --close` audits them, the reviewer is triggered by one specific
transition. That only works if every writer spells them the same way, so the
vocabulary lives here and nowhere else: no string literal like ``"supported"``
belongs in a command, a skill, or the WebUI.

Three things are frozen here and each has a reason:

**Kinds and statuses.** `proposition` is the unit with a truth value and it is
the only kind with a full lifecycle. `question` is open-ended — it has no truth
value, its children are propositions, and it closes when they answer it.
`line` is a research line whose note body *is* its STATUS, so its statuses are
phases of work rather than claims about the world. `run` is one unattended
exploration (docs/design-auto.md): its body is the contract a person signed,
its Discussion is the trajectory, and its status is the *phase* — whether the
agent in front of it is there to talk or to act.

**Legal transitions.** Not to police research — an agent that discovers the
answer in the literature may go from ``open`` straight to ``supported`` and
that is allowed — but to catch bookkeeping mistakes: a status word from the
wrong kind, or a move out of a terminal state. ``superseded`` is terminal
because a proposition replaced by a published paper is finished; if it comes
back it is a new proposition, with a new slug.

**Whose decision a transition is.** Almost everything belongs to whoever is
nearest (design principle: 记账靠近). The exceptions are the adjudications:
closing a line is a ritual reserved for a person, and ``conflict``,
``disputed`` and ``closed`` are left only by a human decision, because each of
them exists precisely to stop the machine from settling the question itself.

Nothing enforces this yet, and the docstring says so rather than letting the
table read as a guarantee. `threads.validate()` checks only that a posted
transition is *legal*, because a post's signature names the host that wrote it
(`claude`, `codex`) and not whose call it was — and the agent transcribing a
person's decision is the normal case, not an evasion. Enforcement needs the
decision itself on record, which is `magi sync --close` and `decisions.md` in
M2. Until then this table is the policy those checks will read.

Temperature (`tier_of`) is derived here too, because for notes under
``threads/`` it is a function of ``kind + status`` and files never move between
tiers. Everywhere else it is a function of the directory alone.
