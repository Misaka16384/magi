"""magi ingest batch-* — run the queue, review what came out, commit the keepers.

The shape this enforces is the point of the whole exercise: acquisition and
conversion are deterministic and happen without asking anyone anything, and then
*nothing reaches the library* until a person says so, once, for a whole batch.

The gate is at commit, not at review. Waiting for every item to finish before
anyone can look would let one slow conversion — MinerU's timeout is thirty
minutes — hold a hundred good ones hostage. An item becomes reviewable the
moment it is written to the log; it becomes real only at commit.
