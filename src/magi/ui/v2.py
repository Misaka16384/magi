"""The v2 human surface, as HTTP.

The browser gets a *projection* of `threads/` and never a stored copy of one. A
cached map is a second answer to a question the notes already answer, and the
two disagree the first time somebody edits a file outside the UI — which they
will, because the files are the point.

The split of labour is the one the CLI already makes: Python decides, the
browser draws. A row arrives already knowing it is stalled, already carrying
the sentence to show a person, and already listing which statuses it may become
and who is allowed to say so. Nothing here hands the browser a rule to apply,
because a rule applied in two places is a rule that ends up meaning two things
(design-v2 D4).

Every endpoint answers with the fields the matching `--json` prints, for the
same reason: a dashboard reporting a different number than the terminal is
worse than no dashboard, since one of them is wrong and there is no way to tell
which from the outside.
