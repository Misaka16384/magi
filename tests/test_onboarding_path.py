"""The path a new workspace actually walks: init -> ingest -> compile -> search.

Each test here is a place that path used to stop without saying so.

The worst of them: once a source landed in `raw/`, nothing anywhere told the
reader to compile it. `magi sync` emitted `ingest-start` only while the
workspace was *completely* empty, and the moment a document arrived the only
remaining hint was "track them as tasks". A user who ingested eighteen papers
through the WebUI was told to file eighteen issues about them, did, and ended
up with an empty `wiki/concepts/`.
