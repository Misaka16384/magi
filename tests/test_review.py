"""`magi review` — the second reader, and the limits on what it may do.

The rule is "记账靠近，评判远离": whoever is nearest records the state, and
somebody who does not share their context judges whether it holds. An agent
grading its own work is not a review — it was convinced once already, by the
same reasoning, and the second pass agrees for the same reasons.

So the two properties tested hardest here are about restraint rather than
capability. A rejection lands as `disputed` and stops: it is a question for a
person, not a finding, and nothing walks it back without one. And an answer
nobody can parse is `unclear`, never a pass — a broken adapter that reads as
approval is a rubber stamp, which is worse than no reviewer at all.

No test in this file runs a real CLI. What is being checked is the contract
around the call, which is the part that can be wrong in a way nobody notices.
