"""Conjecture or finding, the bet command, and how `next` talks to people.

The protocol assumed a proposition is opened, bet on, then worked. A day of
real research ran the other way: the number came out first and the note was
opened about it, so every bet asked for was placed after the answer, and the
person was asked five times for predictions worth nothing. `found:` records
that a result came before its note and takes the question away.

The same day produced the other two habits tested here. `magi next` said
"post what you found, or move it" about a proposition opened that morning —
research runs on weeks. And it surfaced the bet, the disputed claim and the
line's phase one per turn, each an interruption; they are one conversation.
