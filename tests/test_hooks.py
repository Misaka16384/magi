"""The two hooks beyond the stop gate, and the one rule all three obey.

**A hook must not be able to break a session.** Everything here ends in exit 0
with parseable JSON, including the paths where the workspace is missing, the
payload is not JSON, or the file cannot be written. A hook that errors is a
hook the person turns off, and then the gate it was guarding is gone with it —
which is a worse outcome than every failure it was protecting against.

`fanout` counts sub-agent spawns and blocks none. Invariant 5 asks the agent to
say what a fan-out costs before starting one; counting makes that checkable,
and design-v2 §13 is explicit that MAGI hard-manages only the calls it starts
itself. A sub-agent is the agent's own work on the person's own account.

`session-start` is where background work goes, because §7 says there is no
daemon.
